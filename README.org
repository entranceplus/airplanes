Helpers to deploy stuff

** What is this?

This project is structured with the [[https://github.com/danielsz/system/][system]] library.
This starts a web server in development mode, and a web server + remote repl in production.
The build tool used in this project is [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]].

** Instructions
*** Development

Run a development pipeline from the command line:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ boot dev
#+END_SRC

This will start a remote nrepl session


_Note_: Please make sure ~build.boot~ requires the system var in its namespace declarations.
