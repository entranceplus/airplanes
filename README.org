* Airplanes
Live environment for working with [[https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd][lambdacd]] pipelines.
Deprecated in favour of https://github.com/entranceplus/airplanes .

** What is this?
This project is structured with the [[https://github.com/danielsz/system/][system]] library.
This starts a web server in development mode, and a web server + remote repl in production.
The build tool used in this project is [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]].

** Instructions
*** Development

Run a development pipeline from the command line:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ boot dev
#+END_SRC

This will start a remote nrepl session

You can write your pipelines in pipeline.clj.

For example, if this is your pipeline-defs that you are passing to
new-lambdacd-pipeline (see systems.clj)
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:demo demo-pipeline-def
 :other other-pipeline-def}
#+END_SRC

Then, the demo build will be available at
http://localhost:9000/lambdaui/demo/lambdaui/index.html and other build at
http://localhost:9000/lambdaui/other/lambdaui/index.html

_Note_: Please make sure ~build.boot~ requires the system var in its namespace declarations.
